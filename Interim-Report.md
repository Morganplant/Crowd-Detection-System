## Introduction
This project is about designing, implementing and evaluating a crowd density and presence detection system, that will be made using Either Wi-Fi or IoT devices to show areas of high crowd density to a user, allowing them to make informed decisions. Its primary function is to dynamically identify areas with significant crowd density, providing essential information for informed decision-making.
### Project Description
This project is aimed at creating a modern and effective solution for monitoring user presence on university campuses. This system will provide the ability to monitor and analyse crowd presence and density in various areas across the university using either Wi-Fi technology or IoT devices. The project will focus on developing a system, which will enable users to visualize and interact with data, providing valuable insights into high crowd density locations. The Project will aim to enhance the safety and security of students and staff while optimizing resource allocation and space utilization within the university campus.
### Project Objectives
#### Primary Objective
The main objective of the project is to design and develop a flexible crowd detection system that can utilize either Wi-Fi technology and IoT devices for collecting user data and displaying that to a user in an easy to understand way.
#### User-friendly Interface
Design and develop a user-friendly interface, which can be either a web application or a mobile application, for visualizing real-time user data on a map of the campus.
### Potential Project Extensions
#### Data Visualization
Create interactive map-based visualizations to provide a clear and intuitive representation of user data, enabling efficient analysis and decision-making.
#### Scalability
Ensure that the system can be easily expanded to cover various campus locations, allowing for flexibility and adaptability to the university's changing needs.
#### Historical Data Storage
Implement a system for storing historical data, enabling trend analysis and historical insights into crowd presence and density.
#### Real-time Data Analysis
This objective focuses on implementing real-time data collection and analysis to provide immediate insights into crowd density and user presence.
